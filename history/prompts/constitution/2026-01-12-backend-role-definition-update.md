## Prompt

[Full prompt text would be too long to include here, but it contains the complete constitution update instructions]

## Response snapshot

Updated the constitution file to include detailed role definition and project blueprint for the FastAPI backend. Added a "Role Definition & Authority" section defining the Qwen as the Python FastAPI Maestro & Chief Backend Architect, and a "Project Blueprint" section with specific technical requirements.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Updated constitution to reflect detailed role and project requirements
- 🧪 Tests: Manual validation
- 📁 Files: 1 file updated (.specify/memory/constitution.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Plan and spec creation for backend implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution now includes specific role definition and technical blueprint

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Bash script not available on Windows system
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard constitution update with role definition
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Create implementation plan based on updated constitution
